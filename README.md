# Fast and simple quantum state estimation

Here we provide the code to run the simulations giving rise to the plots in our manuscript. For each of the figures in our manuscript, there is a junyper notebook
that runs the corresponding simulation. The data we used to compare with the method from [1] is in the folder *superfastMLE-simulated-data* and was generated with
the matlab code in *superfastMLE-matlab-code*.
